I am a Teaching Assistant at the University of the South Pacific, Fiji. 
I currently teach English for Academic Purposes, but I have taught linguistics, and am currently co-developing Rotuman language courses. 
I am interested in the sociolinguistic variation of lesser-documented languages by investigating phonetic, phonological, and morphosyntactic variables. 
Within the variationist paradigm, I enjoy looking at social meaning -- how speakers employ variables to index identity and stance. I also enjoy researching language changing by triangulating the comparative method and sociolingusitic methods.
