# About Me

I am a Teaching Assistant at the University of the South Pacific, Fiji. 
I currently teach English for Academic Purposes, but I have taught linguistics, and am currently co-developing Rotuman language courses. 


## Research

I am interested in the sociolinguistic variation of lesser-documented languages, investigating phonetic, phonological, and morphosyntactic variables. 
Within the variationist paradigm, I enjoy looking at social meaningâ€”how speakers employ variables to index identity and stance. I also enjoy researching language change by triangulating the comparative method and sociolinguistic methods.
